# MusicApp - BootStrap Operator

This project provides a foundation for a bootstrap operator service designed to initialize and manage core services for a music-oriented application. It includes database setup, configuration management, and operational utilities.

## Features

- Configuration management for environment-specific settings
- Database integration with models for persistent data
- Service layer for business logic encapsulation
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance
- Automated setup script for rapid deployment
